ncempy.eval
===========

The ``ncempy.eval`` module contains evaluation routines to address various data evaluation or simulation problems. They are made combining the algorithms found in ``ncempy.algo`` acting as bulding blocks for this higher layer of abstraction. An evaluation contained in ``ncempy.eval`` targets a specific problem and should not be reused/imported into another evaluation.
